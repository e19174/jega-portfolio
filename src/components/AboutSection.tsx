        I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Peradeniya with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, cloud computing, IoT, and machine learning. I have built end-to-end systems ranging from smart greenhouse automation with ESP32 sensors to management information systems using Spring Boot and React. My research interests include network security and intrusion detection. I thrive on solving complex problems and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to real-world engineering projects and software teams.
